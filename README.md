# Event Bus / Chain of Resp.

`$rootScope.$emit` only lets other $rootScope listeners catch it. This is good when you don't want every $scope to get it. Mostly a high level communication. Think of it as adults talking to each other in a room so the kids can't hear them.

`$rootScope.$broadcast` is a method that lets pretty much everything hear it. This would be the equivalent of parents yelling that dinner is ready so everyone in the house hears it.

`$scope.$emit` is when you want that $scope and all its parents and $rootScope to hear the event. This is a child whining to their parents at home (but not at a grocery store where other kids can hear).

`$scope.$broadcast` is for the $scope itself and its children. This is a child whispering to its stuffed animals so their parents can't hear.
